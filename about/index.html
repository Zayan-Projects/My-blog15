    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <hr>
Hello! My name is Muhammad Zayan Naseem, and I am a student at SMIT Institute, Paposh.
I started my journey in web development with a deep interest in how websites are created and how technology connects the world.
When I first joined SMIT, everything about coding was completely new to me — I didn’t even know what HTML and CSS really were.<br><br>

My first class was all about introduction to web development, where I learned how the internet works and what makes a website function.
In the second class, our instructor taught us the basic structure of HTML, and that’s when I built my very first simple web page.
Later, we were given an assignment to create a CV using only HTML, but I decided to take it one step further and added CSS by myself.
That experience gave me confidence and made me realize how powerful coding can be.As the classes continued, we moved to more advanced topics, and our teacher gave us another task — to create a normal website with multiple pages such as Home, About Us, Contact Us, and Blog, and to link all these pages together.
Even though it was supposed to be made only with HTML, I chose to add CSS to make my design more creative and visually attractive.
This project helped me understand the importance of design, structure, and layout in web development.<br><br>

After that, we also made a Periodic Table using HTML, which improved my skills in organizing and structuring data properly.
And now, I am working on this Blog Website project, where I can finally apply everything I have learned so far — HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and my creativity for presentation.

Through this blog, I want to share my journey of learning technology, and show how consistent practice and interest can make anyone better in coding.
My dream is to become a professional web developer and to build websites that are useful, beautiful, and easy to use.
I believe that learning never stops, and every new project teaches me something new.<br><br>

Thank you for visiting my blog and taking the time to read about my journey.
I hope that my work inspires other students to start learning, experimenting, and believing in their abilities — because every great developer once started from the basics, just like me.
